Hetman's Artificial Leader. Originally created by Rydygier, Updated by NinjaRider6000, Documented by Rockdood

At this time, this is meant to allow for better tracking of bugs/issues/suggestions for the current release of NR6 HAL on steam by NinjaRider600. This started off the most recent version that was available on the workshop.

This fork constains experimental fixes and updates alongside sqfc files [binarized sqf - for a better performance] made by Radek [Radek5311 on discord, or Radekj1 on github] and NinjaRider6000, before they will get pulled into the main branch. To test them you can subscribe to [Experimental version](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3375984704) need to 'pbo' folders inside addons directory and replace existing hal with a new one, or add this nr6 hal as a local mod. To pbo files you can use arma 3 tools, or [pboman](https://github.com/winseros/pboman3/releases).
