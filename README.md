# NR6-HAL
Hetman's Artificial Leader. Originally created by Rydygier, Updated by NinjaRider6000, Documented by Rockdood

At this time, this is meant to allow for better tracking of bugs/issues/suggestions for the current release of NR6 HAL on steam by NinjaRider600. This started off the most recent version that was available on the workshop.

_

This fork constains experimental fixes and updates alongside sqfc files [binarized sqf - for a better performance] made by Radek [Radek5311 on discord, or Radekj1 on github]. To test them you need to 'pbo' folders inside addons directory and replace existing hal with a new one, or add this nr6 hal as a local mod. To pbo files you can use arma 3 tools, or [pboman](https://github.com/winseros/pboman3/releases).

Currently only a mission maker, or a host / server require modified version without a need of forcing each user to fix, however it might change in the future when the all known bugs will be fixed and a new possible icons / features would be implemented. 

Then it might get a new steam workshop release [with a new signed files]. 

If you can't 'pbo' the files, or you are getting some kind of the error, then there is an alternative link here:
